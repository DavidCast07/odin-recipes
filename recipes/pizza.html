        <h1>Two-ingredient pizza recipe</h1>
        <p>This 2-ingredient pizza dough is fast and easy to make and tastes great! Greek yogurt is 
            the secret ingredient and baking the crust at a higher temperature is the key to making this 
            the perfect pizza. It doesn't get any easier than this folks. Brush dough with olive oil, add your favorite toppings, and enjoy!</p>
